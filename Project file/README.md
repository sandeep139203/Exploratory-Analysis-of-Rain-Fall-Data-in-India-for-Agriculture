# Exploratory_Analysis_of_Rain_Fall_Data_in_India_for_Agriculture
The Rainfall Prediction System is a Machine Learning web application that predicts whether it will rain tomorrow based on historical weather data.

This project uses the WeatherAUS dataset and applies data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and classification algorithms to build an accurate rainfall prediction model.

The trained model is deployed using the Flask web framework, allowing users to input weather conditions and receive real-time predictions.
